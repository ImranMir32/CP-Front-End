            Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls
            itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem by
            breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a function is called, it executes its code and returns a
            result. In the case of a recursive function, the function may call
            itself one or more times with different input values, until a base
            case is reached that does not require further recursive calls. At
            this point, the function returns a result to the previous call in
            the call stack, which in turn may return its result to the caller
            that invoked it, until the original caller finally receives the
            result of the computation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recursion is commonly used in programming for tasks such as
            traversing tree or graph structures, searching and sorting
            algorithms, and many other problems that can be broken down into
            smaller instances of the same problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recursion can be a powerful tool in programming, but it can also
            lead to performance issues and stack overflow errors if not used
            carefully.
