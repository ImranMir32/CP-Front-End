            A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can
            be used repeatedly in a program. Functions are used to break down
            complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, making it
            easier to write and maintain programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions in programming typically have an input, which is called an
            argument, and an output, which is called a return value. The
            argument is a value or a set of values that are passed to the
            function for processing, and the return value is the result of the
            processing performed by the function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions can be called by other parts of the program to perform
            their specific task, which can make the code more modular and easier
            to understand. By using functions, programmers can create reusable
            code that can be used in multiple parts of a program, reducing the
            amount of code that needs to be written and making the program more
            efficient.
