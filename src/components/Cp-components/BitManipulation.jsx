            Bit manipulation refers to the process of performing operations on
            individual bits, which are the smallest units of data in a computer.
            Bit manipulation allows you to perform bitwise operations, which are
            operations that are performed on each corresponding bit of two
            operands.
          </p>
          <p>Some common bitwise operations include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              AND: returns a 1 in each bit position where both operands have a 1
            </li>
            <li>
              OR: returns a 1 in each bit position where at least one operand
              has a 1
            </li>
            <li>
              XOR: returns a 1 in each bit position where only one operand has a
              1
            </li>
            <li>
              NOT: returns the opposite of each bit in the operand (i.e., 0
              becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Bit manipulation is commonly used in programming for tasks such as
            encoding and decoding data, manipulating binary numbers, and
            performing low-level optimizations. It can be a powerful tool for
            improving performance and reducing memory usage in certain
            applications.
          </p>

            For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that
            its running time grows linearly with the size of its input, while an
            algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) means that its running
            time grows quadratically with the size of its input.
