            In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters that
            represents text or data. It is a data type that is used to store a
            series of characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces,
            in a contiguous memory location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strings are usually enclosed in quotation marks, either single ('')
            or double (""). For example, "Hello, World!" and '12345' are both
            strings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strings can be manipulated using a variety of string functions, such
            as concatenation (joining two or more strings together), substring
            extraction (getting a portion of a string), and searching (finding
            the position of a particular character or sequence of characters
            within a string).
          </p>
          <p>
            Strings are a fundamental concept in programming and are used
            extensively in many programming languages, including Python, Java,
            C++, and JavaScript.
